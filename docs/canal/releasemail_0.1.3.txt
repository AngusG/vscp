New version of CANAL/VSCP released


Version 0.1.3 of CANAL has been released today. This is mainly a bugfix release.


This release fixes the following issues:

- Fixed byteorder bug in UDP receive routine that failed to receive VSCP messages due to size interpreted wrong.

- Fixed constant renaming problem that made the Unix code fail to build.

- Increased the number of clients that can connect to 4096.

- Increased the number of devices that can be connected to 4096. Also fixed id uniqueness problem so that a 
device now have id's starting at 0x00010000 and client have id's starting at 0x00000000. Id's 0x00xx0000 is reserved 
for future types.

- Added the m swich to cancmd to input decimal numbers as normalized integers.



Also version 1.1 of the VSCP specification has been released and a testsuite for VSCP is now available.


The stuff can be downloaded from http://www.vscp.org and from http://www.vscp.org where the CVS also 
is available.


Enjoy!
