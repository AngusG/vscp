VSCP stands for 'very simple control protocol', it is an automation protocol suitable for all
sorts of automation jobs among which home-automation. In a VSCP network a common
physical layer (wired bus, radio link, ...) connects the individual nodes to form the
automation network. This network is a distributed system with all nodes working
autonomous. On the bus there can be nodes reading switches, there can be nodes
controlling lamps, nodes that read temperature, … .
VSCP is independent from the physical layer (bus) used. There is a subset of the protocol
that is very much tailored to the CAN bus. There is also a version of the protocol
intended for Ethernet, one for TCP and also a wireless version of the protocol. All share the
same common message fields & framework.

VSCP & Friends is an open software suite with user (interface) tools and an SDK available for Windows 
and Linux that can be used to setup automation systems that are based on different technologies among 
them the Tellstick from Telldus.  This is a complete automation solution in which you can mix devices 
from many vendors.
