This is a Level II driver for the linux lmsensors interface

The driver read the sensor values from the textfiles and convert the 
values there to events at periodic intervals. 

Variables 
=========
A driver is opened with a supplied prefix. This prefix is added in from of
the variable name described below. For example if a prefix "lmsensor1" is 
supplied the the variables read would be lmsensor1_numberffsensors, 
lmsensor1_guid0, lmsensor1_path0 and so on.

_numberffsensors - This is the number of sensors that the driver is supposed
to read. Sensors are numbered staring with zero. 

_guidn - GUID for sensor n. guid0, guid1, guid2 etc
_pathn - Path to value for example 
          /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input
        which is CPU temp for core 1
        on the system this is written at.
_intervaln - Interval in Seconds the event should be sent out. Zero disables.
_codingn     - Coding for the value. See section 8 in specification.
_dividen     - Divide value with this integer. Default is 1.
_multiplyn   - Multiply value with this integer. Default is 1.
