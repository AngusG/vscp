.TP
-c
.TP
--config-file Load configuration from a file. If not given, the default values as described in vscpd.conf5 are used.  
.TP
-d
.TP
--daemon Run vscpd in the background as a daemon. All other behaviour remains the same.  
.TP
-p
.TP
--port Listen on the port specified instead of the default 1883. This acts in addition to the port setting in the config file. May be specified multiple times to open multiple sockets listening on different ports. This socket will be bound to all network interfaces.  
.TP
-v
.TP
--verbose Use verbose logging. This is equivalent to setting 
.TP
log_type to 
.TP
all in the configuration file. This overrides and logging options given in the configuration file.     Configuration The vscpd daemon can be configured using a configuration file as described in vscpd.conf5 and this is the main point of information for vscp. The files required for SSL/TLS support are described in vscp-tls7.   Signals SIGHUP Upon receiving the SIGHUP signal, vscpd will attempt to reload configuration file data, assuming that the 
.TP
-c argument was provided when vscpd was started. Not all configuration parameters can be reloaded without restarting. See vscpd.conf5 for details.   SIGUSR1 Upon receiving the SIGUSR1 signal, vscpd will write the persistence database to disk. This signal is only acted upon if persistence is enabled.   SIGUSR2 The SIGUSR2 signal causes vscpd to print out the current subscription tree, along with information about where retained messages exist. This is intended as a testing feature only and may be removed at any time.     Files /etc/vscp/vscpd.conf Configuration file. See vscpd.conf5.   /etc/hosts.allow /etc/hosts.deny Host access control via tcp-wrappers as described in hosts_access5.

The project started in the autumn of year 2000 and is still under active development. Many hours that should have been spent with family and children has been spent in front of a screen in the office instead. A bad choice but there was no other path to walk.
